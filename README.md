Business Understanding & Overview...
   The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. 
   Because of that, some consumers use it to their advantage by becoming a defaulter. Suppose you work for a consumer 
 finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. You have to use EDA to analyse the patterns 
 present in the data. This will ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.
    So, we will perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in order to get insights, analyze the data, summarize the characteristics of the 
 data and present it to the companies so  that they can take necessary actions in order to reject or accept loan applications.

      
                        
Steps involved in the Exploratory data analysis process:- 

  1. Data sourcing
  2. Data cleaning
  3. Data processing
  4. Data visualisations
  5. Conclusions from the visualisations
